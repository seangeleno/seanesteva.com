    <p><b>Goleta Beach Triathlon Race Report</b></p>
    <p><b>Pre- Race</b></p>
    <p>I had been looking forward to racing at Goleta Beach for quite a while, a friend of mine, Aaron, had contacted me
        via text during Wildflower weekend to see if I had signed-up yet because prices were going up. Unfortunately, in
        the end, Aaron was not able to attend.</p>
    <p>I drove up with my mom on Saturday afternoon. It was a quick drive up PCH then 101, we stayed at the Motel 6 in
        Carpinteria as we didn’t make reservations until the last minute. It was a nice motel. We went to a Tapas bar
        before heading over to have dinner. I found a  great place while studying at UCSB, it is called Olio e  Limone,
        a super swanky Italian restaurant right off of State St. Did a little hob-knobing with the local Santa
        Barbarians and went straight to bed. </p>
    <p><b>Race Morning</b></p>
    <p>I woke up at 1:28am, unable to sleep, the air-conditioning had been turned off and it was way too hot in there. I
        was so excited for the race that I couldn’t fall back asleep the entire night. I read blogs of other
        triathletes, in the darkness, as well as slow-motion videos of a dude throwing-up milk, which I found hilarious.
        I tried to contain my laughter in bed.</p>
    <p>We arrived to the event at about 5:30am and my wave didn’t start until 8:00am so that gave me plenty of time to
        chill. It was extremely foggy that morning, you could barely see the giant yellow buoys in the distance, this
        caused the race to be delayed a few minutes. I felt very relaxed and confident, I knew it would be a great
        race.</p>

    <p><b>Swim – 25:56 ~1:28/100yds</b></p>
    <p>I had a really good swim. All the training sessions with Tower 26 have really began to come to fruition and
        allowed me to be a faster swimmer than ever before. As the swim started a few guys jetted out and never looked
        back, leaving me with everyone else, vying for position towards the front. As we approached the first turn buoy
        there were a few people ahead of me. This allowed me to get behind their feet, drafting, saving energy. Before I
        knew it, I was in the front of this giant pack of men, to the point where I turned around to make sure I was not
        off-course. It was a very unusual feeling for me. I was pushing as hard as I could while still maintaining a
        calm demeanor. At one point the pace was too intense,  nevertheless, I managed to keep my cool and return to a
        more comfortable pace.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-14"

    <p>I can’t believe what an improvement I have made from last year where I did the same swim in 33:24. </p>

    <p><b>T1 - 00:02:39</b></p>
    <p>I was out of breath by the time I reached the timing mat. I ran as fast as I could over to my bike and wiped my
        dirty feet with the towel I had. I opted not to use socks with my road shoes, it was totally fine. </p>
    <p>I forgot to hit the lap button on my Garmin until I was a few miles out on the bike course, this messed up my
        times with the GPS. </p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://seangeleno.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/img_0258.jpg"><img
            class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12"

            height="300"/></a></p>
    <p><b>Bike - 01:10:39 - 18.7 MPH</b></p>
    <p>The bike leg went OK, I don’t think I did enough training on the bike, it felt as if my full potential could not
        be reached. I wanted to go faster but my legs simply wouldn’t let me. At one point I got totally “chicked” by a
        UCLA bruin #407, Kelly Kosmo, she passed me by as if I was standing still, even though I was pushing as hard as
        I could. I tried to keep-up at one point, to no avail, leaving me in the dust within minutes. She later lapped
        me on the run. It was very inspiring, hopefully one day I will be that fast. </p>
    <p>The bike course was very familiar as it was where I first started training for triathlons back in November of
        2012. There were many pot holes along the road, however, many of them have been fixed since I last rode on it.
        There were many sharp, blind, dangerous turns on the course which slowed the pace down quite a bit. There were
        no aid stations during this part, I had to carry my own water, which I was expecting, so it wasn’t so bad. I had
        two bottles, each one with a GU salt tablet, creating electrolyte enhanced water, just what I needed to avoid
        cramping. </p>
    <p>I began to realize what a huge difference there is with the longer distance races as there is hardly any time to
        even drink as you are pushing as hard as you can the entire way. Whereas, with the longer distances, they
        require a more steady flow of energy throughout, allowing the feeding process to be more calm. </p>
    <p>Also, another thing worth mentioning was that the bike course was a narrow two-way course, so passing other
        riders was a rather perilous affair, risking a head-on collision every time. </p>
    <p><b>T2 00:02:21</b></p>
    <p>I un-buckled my bike shoes as I was approaching T2, it was the culmination of many attempts at doing T2 in races.
        Flawless. Hoped off/racked my bike, but m  Brooks Pure Cadence 2 shoes on and ran out of T2 as fast as
        possible. </p>
    <p>Had to brush my feet clean a bit, obviously, could’ve been faster but I was satisfied with what I did at the
        moment. </p>
    <p><b>Run - 5 miles - 00:38:40 - 00:07:44 min/mi</b></p>
    <p>The run course was spectacular, very short and comfortable. You could see the entirety of the course from the
        beginning, this allowed you to see how the competition was doing. I could see people catching up to me and then
        passing me with little or no problem. My legs felt great at this point, when I would look at my watch I kept
        thinking that I was going too fast as I usually can’t run much faster than 8:00 minute/mi on my training runs.
        However, in retrospect, I could’ve pushed the pace much more. </p>
    <p>I hadn’t paid much attention to the map details prior to the start of the race, so, I wasn’t exactly sure how
        long the run distance was, only that it was 4 laps. This threw me off a bit, I could’ve pushed harder.</p>
    <p>I felt very relaxed the entire run, making sure to thank the volunteers as I passed them. Towards the end,
        though, I felt more focused and ran past without even looking.mnm</p>
    <p><b>Finish </b></p>
    <p>At the end of the 4th lap of the run I asked one of the volunteers what to do next, he gave me directions and I
        ran to the finish line. My legs were beginning to show slight signs of cramping as I had forgotten my race belt
        at home, I didn’t have my salt pills. </p>
    <p>I felt an overwhelming sense of joy at what I had just accomplished, I knew I could push so much harder and would
        do that much better in the future. There was still adrenaline racing through my veins and I couldn’t really eat
        for about 30 minutes, at which point I gained a ravenous appetite. I smelled gnarly. Luckily, the Motel 6 room
        had a 12 pm check-out, this left me a whole hour to shower and get ready for the drive back</p>
