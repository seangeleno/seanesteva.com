    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>Kendra’s Race 2014 Race Report</b></span>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>Pre-Race</b></span></p>
    I have been very excited for this race to come up, as it not only marks the first anniversary of my second race ever
    — I’ve come such a far ways since — but it also allowed me to go back to my alma mater: UCSB.

    I was lucky enough to be accompanied by Claire and the ride up to Santa Barbara was quick and beautiful. Although,
    there was a bit of trouble trying to find a place to stay, we eventually settled for Super 8 in Goleta, it was
    perfect located for the race, a mere 2 miles from the start.

    We decided to get some food, as this would be crucial for having the right nutrition for race day. So, we went to
    Whole Foods, where they have a wonderful selection of healthy foods and got almond milk, pre-mixed granola, fruit,
    yogurt and several other healthy things. After that was done, there was thing left to do: FREEBIRDS! This is a must
    when visiting Isla Vista, a true classic. Once we finished stuffing our faces with the famous Quesarito —  if a
    quesadilla and a burrito had a kid, this is what it would look like  — we retreated back to the motel and called it
    a night.
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>Race Day</b></span></p>
    Luckily, it was a very straight shot to get to the transition zone and the parking was accessible and reasonably
    priced ($4 for all day), so, that was done quickly and without issues.

    This has to be probably the most uncoordinated, on-the-fly race I have ever attended; no chiming tips, one end of
    the transition area was wide open, nobody who was working knew of a place to get water (instead saying there was
    some in the dorms but they weren’t open, so, yeah)

    Eventually, we all headed down to the sea, right by campus point/ UCSB Lagoon and waited for the swim waves to
    start. I was in the second wave with the non-collegiate males, aka Open M/F, it started at 8:05.
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>Race Start</b></span></p>
    As the race started we all ran into the water and jumped in, doing small dolphin dives to get out to open water
    faster. I managed to remain very calm throughout the entire swim, constantly reminding myself that the calmer I
    remained, the better I would be able to swim as I could control my breathing and technique without having to stop
    and rest/ gasp for air.
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>Swim</b></span></p>
    I could really feel the improvement in my technique, strength and stamina from all the pool sessions I have been
    going to lately. As opposed to the usual, “I just want this swim to be over/get me out of here already!” feeling,
    this time it was very enjoyable and rewarding.

    Furthermore, another awesome thing I managed to do during the swim was draft consistently and efficiently. I really
    noticed the difference of trying to swim alone as opposed to following in someones foot stroke. I knew I was doing
    it correctly because I could consistently see the guys bubbles in front of me but I wouldn’t be going too fast as to
    touch his feet.

    Coming out of the water, we all had to walk in the water for about 100 feet as it was only waist deep. Then there
    was the dreaded stairs up to the transition area, which left me feeling out of breath, more so than the entire swim.
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>T1</b></span></p>
    Transition was a breeze as I have been getting much better at this, with the tri-shoes already clipped in and
    dangling from rubber bands, so, I was able to zip through without much issue.
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>Bike</b></span></p>
    The bike leg was so much fun. I was able to really put the hammer down. This is where I first started training for
    triathlon, back in November 2012, when I pulled the trigger on my Scott Plasma 2, so, I was very well acquainted
    with the course. When combined with the short format of the race, there was simply no holding back, I kept passing
    rider after rider in their collegiate tri suits, never allowing myself to go beyond my capabilities while still
    pushing as hard as possible.

    There were a few people who stuck with me on the majority of the bike ride, but there was one guy who I remember
    particularly well. He was riding a Quintana Roo bike and his fitness level was very similar to mine. I can’t
    remember his number. We would consistently pass each other, however, I ultimately held the advantage of knowing the
    course particularly well, thus knowing when to really go hard.

    As we eventually made our way back onto the UCSB campus, via the windy bike bath, I took my feet out of tri shoes
    and hopped off gloriously right before T2
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>T2</b></span></p>
    T2 was good, nice grass on the feet. Took me a second to put on my socks, however the quick laces on the HOKA ONE
    ONE saved me some time. Zipped out of transition, ready to rock the run course — a little too ready perhaps, <b>I
    left with my helmet still firmly attached to my head. </b>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>Run</b></span></p>
    The run course was marvelous, it was a run around the UCSB lagoon, an area I had many training sessions in
    previously. The guy who was on the bike with me was running close by and eventually passed me at about mile 1 and
    held the lead until the dirt trails, through the brushes of the lagoon, at which point I laid the hammer down again,
    and brought it home, sailing in at a time of around 1:4?:??
    <p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Post-Race</span><span
            style="text-decoration:underline;"> Reflections</span></strong></p>
    <b></b>I thoroughly enjoyed participating in this event, it brought back nostalgic memories and was a great tune-up
    for Wildflower. I am definitely looking forward to returning next year.
