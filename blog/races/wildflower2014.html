    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>Wildflower 2014 Race Report</b></span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>Pre-Race</b></span></p>
    <p>I got to the Lake San Antonio campsite almost an entire week before the race on Saturday. I was able to enjoy the
        campground, relax, read and do a little reconnaissance of the course. On Wednesday, April 30 I was able to go
        for a nice ride around the entire bike course, totaling 56 miles by the end of the ride. Unfortunately, this
        time I only took two water bottles and forgot to include any cash, so I was considerably dehydrated and barely
        made it back to the campsite. I must say, it was a very good lesson, it taught me a lot about the importance of
        hydration, especially when you’re in the middle of nowhere, i.e. Central California. I did not want to be too
        tired or sore before the race, so it made sure to take it easy and go at a calm pace.</p>
    <p>On Friday, the day before the race, I went out for a short bike ride, about 12 miles, and managed to see reigning
        champion Jesse Thomas heading out for a ride. It was very exciting for me, one day I want to be just like
        Jesse</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">.<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-22"
                                        src="http://seangeleno.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/img_0104.jpg?w=300"
                                        alt="IMG_0104" width="300" height="224"/></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>Race</b></span></p>
    <p>The race was a bit different than most years this time around. The lake was so low that they had to move the swim
        to an entire different location, a whole two miles from where it usually starts. This meant that we had to run
        back to the bikes, about two miles, and these were discounted from the run later on in the course. </p>
    <p>I was the about the only person in my age group that did not wear a wetsuit, went old school, figured it would be
        so hot during the day anyways that it was really not necessary. I am glad I went with that decision as the water
        temperature was very nice. </p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Swim - 00:37:15 - Pace: 00:01:57 / 100m</strong></span>
    </p>
    <p>I managed to get a nice rhythm in the swim but would start to lose my breath, forcing me to stop and catch it
        again before I could keep swimming. I kept trying to draft behind a swimmer of my same, or similar ability but
        this proved impossible, only managing to keep behind people for a few strokes before they would either take off
        or go to slow. Eventually I looked at my Garmin as I was coming out of the water and I read a time of about 37
        minutes. At this point I was feeling pretty strong, no cramping, ready to take on the next several hours of raw
        endurance. </p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>Run1 - 00:21:31 - Pace 00:09:42</b></span>
    </p>
    <p>The first run went by pretty quickly, although I was definitely trying to keep my pace to around 8:30/mile or so
        as to avoid getting to tired before the bike. Everyone was passing me, but I figured it would be much better to
        conserve energy. The run went through the old lake bed and the GPS would confirm this later as we were running
        on water according to the Garmin. </p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>T1A - 00:05:28</b></span></p>
    <p>I took my time during the transition to the bike as I had to get on all my gear. I made sure to apply sun screen
        and my bolero to avoid getting scorched under the sun. In hind-sight this was a great idea, I saw several other
        athletes with major sun burns. </p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>Bike - 03:46:31 - Pace:14.8MPH</b></span>
    </p>
    <p>I set off for the famous long bike course, it was an exhilarating moment as I knew there was still a tremendous
        amount of work ahead of me. As soon as I hit the very first turn, some dude was trying to get by me when there
        was absolutely no room to squeeze by, yelling “on your left, ON YOUR LEFFFTT ARRRGHH!” which caught me off-guard
        and since there was no room it really annoyed me. </p>
    <p>Shortly after, the real work began, a nasty grade style incline all the way to the top of Lynch hill where the
        campsites were. One guy was looking like he was really struggling, and I thought to myself that if he was
        struggling this soon in to the race, he was in for a LONG day, if he managed to finish at all. </p>
    <p>I decided to really take my time and not push myself since the course would be so long, hard and hilly. This
        worked out greatly, I ended up underestimating my abilities as I still felt pretty strong in my legs towards the
        end of the race. </p>
    <p>The first few miles out of the camp grounds were very hilly, over and over again, having to grind slowly while a
        slew of riders just kept passing me by. I kept thinking how crazy strong and/or stupid these guys were for
        expending so much energy. </p>
    <p>I just kept trudging along and maintaining my own pace as slowly, but surely my bladder began to fill up to
        capacity, making it very uncomfortable to pedal. Luckily for me, there were plenty of port-o-potties along the
        bike course, approximately every 10 miles or so. I would end up making about 5 port-o-potty stops as the same
        situation would present itself multiple times. It didn’t matter how hard I tried to pee on the bike, I could not
        do it for the life of me. I’ve learned that this is a skill unto its own, that must be practiced if one is to
        become good at relieving themselves while riding a time trial, or any bike for that matter. I probably lost a
        few minutes each time I stopped, I think. </p>
    <p>I had to remember to keep taking my nutrition, which included salt pills, and my Hammer Perpeteum made into a
        paste that I tucked into a little bottle holder on my stem. I was amazed at how well these two products work
        with each other. I would constantly get hungry and would just take a swig of my paste, it has calories, so, it
        helped with that. </p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span
            style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>Run - 02:32:32 - Pace: 00:11:38 min/mile</b></span></p>
    <p>The run went pretty well, however, I had to walk a good portion of i as it was extremely steep and I was feeling
        pretty tired. The first few miles went by rather quickly, I hit one aid-station after the other. The Cal Poly
        volunteers were going wild, cheering everyone on.</p>
    <p>At this point the day was starting to get very hot, luckily I had my bolero on so my arms were covered. The
        course was a bit different that years prior since we already ran before getting on the bike. </p>
    <p>I was wearing my Hoka One-One shoes and they felt great. I saw a few other people doing the same thing.
        Unfortunately, they got really dirty with all the dirt trails we had to go through. The views of the former Lake
        San Antonio were breathtaking, I was pacing myself enough to be able to enjoy the views. At around mile 5 I had
        to make a dash to the port-o-potty and find relief. I realized I probably hadn’t dialed in my nutrition quite
        right the night before and was suffering for it on the run. </p>
    <p>At this point my feet really started to hurt, partly because my cycling cleats were secured way too tight during
        the ride. I felt tired, hungry and ready to get to the finish line. I tried to keep up my pace but it proved
        very difficult. As I approached mile 9 or so, a group of Cal Poly volunteers pulled up their shirts and flashed
        me and a few other guys with their bare breasts — considered a yearly tradition — this made us pick up the pace
        just a bit. </p>
    <p><b> </b>I had a vague idea of what the run course would look like, this was an important mistake. After running
        mile after mile, we started to head back through the park’s main gate, a sure sign that we were close to the
        finish line. However, this was a bit disillusioning since there was still a considerable portion left of the
        run, we still had to traverse the camp sites, do a few loops and then finally head down the infamous Lynch hill.
        Lynch Hill is a special hill, it is extremely steep and has many sharp, dangerous turns. By the time I arrived I
        couldn’t wait to reach the finish line, I was reaching the end of my limit.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
    <p>I had an amazing time at Wildflower this year. There was several important differences that I made from the year
        before that allowed me to have a much better experience this time around. Last year, I had just injured my
        shoulder a few days before the race while riding around Lake Tahoe. It was terrible, I was diagnosed with
        Bursitis and given some anti-inflammatory, this didn’t help much and I needed some good old rest. However, I had
        been waiting for this event for so long that I didn’t even consider skipping the race. Even though it was just
        the Olympic distance it not only hindered my performance but it also did further damage to my shoulder. </p>
    <p>This time around it was my second ever half-ironman triathlon and I was considerably intimidated by the entire
        thing. However, keeping a cool mind, riding the course a few days before and training very hard allowed me to
        exceed my expectations. I went the entirety of the course without cramping, something that was previously
        unheard of for me. It was the first taste of what the distance has to offer.</p>
    <p>I particularly learned that there is a tremendous difference between short/medium (sprint/olympic) and longer
        course racing. While the former relies way more heavily on raw power and not so much on nutrition, the latter
        requires a much more even-keeled mindset. I was able to get a preview of what the rest of my half-ironman and
        beyond races would feel like. </p>
