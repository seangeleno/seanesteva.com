    <p><strong>Race Date: 05/18/2014</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Pre-Race</strong></p>
    <p>I had to drive 400 mi to San Francisco, leaving on Saturday morning, spending one night at a 1 star motel and
        then driving back to be at my 6AM shift on Monday morning. It was quite a journey, especially since I was
        totally alone.</p>
    <p>Staying in San Francisco, in the Tenderloin district was very disturbing, there were addicts and hustlers
        everywhere you looked. I managed to find a parking lot structure that had 24 hour parking for $20.  The only
        problem was that they closed from 2AM to 6AM and I had to be at the ferry at 5AM. This meant that I had to try
        and sleep from about 9PM on Saturday until around 130AM Sunday, gather my things and leave my roach motel, get
        to my car and then try to find a place to park closer to the ferry. Also, I had to wait from 2AM until 5AM, or
        about 3 hours in a city that I was not acquainted with at all. Luckily, I found a nice, secluded spot in the
        Presidio to park and try to get some shut-eye.</p>
    <p><strong>Ferry Ride</strong></p>
    <p>The ferry ride was quite exciting, being able to travel around the bay with a bunch of like-minded athletes that
        were all about to jump out into the freezing cold water with me. It took quite a while to finally get out to
        Alcatraz, however, I waited patiently until it was time to jump in the water.</p>
    <p>We were given brief instructions on what to sight on while traversing the bay. Firstly, we had to sight on Fort
        Mason, then the Yacht Club and finally the green copper dome of the Palace of Fine Arts. They only gave us a
        5-minute window to jump off the ferry, so It all happened very quickly. Before you knew it, we were all out.</p>
    <p><strong>Swim – 00:45:33 – Pace: 00:01:53 / mile</strong></p>
    <p> As soon as I hit the water it was a pure adrenaline surge, the waves were huge, toppling over my head, leaving
        me gasping for air. Everyone started swimming away, seemingly undisturbed by the difficult swimming
        conditions.</p>
    <p>At first it was hard for me to get a good rhythm going, as soon as I would try and gasp for air a wave would
        collapse on my head and make me stop. This happened several times, until, finally, I started to develop a tactic
        for breathing. I would have to time my breathing so that I would come out of the water at the crest of the
        second wave, meaning that I would have to stay underwater for 2 more seconds than usual.</p>
    <p>All of the sighting objects seemed so far away, this coupled with how hard it was for me to even get a good
        stroke cadence made it seem like I would be out there for a very long time. Nevertheless, I kept pushing, hard,
        eventually realizing that I was making good progress. Although I noticed that I had deviated off course a bit,
        my fellow athletes were already on shore, running towards the end of the swim.</p>
    <p><strong>Transition – 00:02:54</strong></p>
    <p>I ran on the sand until I reached the pavement of T1. Tried to be as fast as possible, get my running shoes on,
        my glasses and get out of dodge as soon as possible.</p>
    <p><strong>Run – 01:02:47 – Pace: 00:08:58</strong></p>
    <p>I felt strong during the run, I originally thought it was only 6 miles, so, I may have pushed a little too hard
        considering it was actually 7 miles. The run started out on a gravel trail, then lead to a set of stairs  all
        the way to the Golden Gate Bridge. It was one of the most breath-taking vistas I had every had the opportunity
        to traverse. I first glance, one might not notice the curvature of the bridge, however, it definitely becomes
        noticeable as you try and run as fast as possible across it.</p>
