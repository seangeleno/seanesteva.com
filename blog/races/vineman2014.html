    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b> Vineman 2014 Race Report</b></span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"> </p>
    <p>Getting to the Santa Rosa area was quite a task, it involved many hours of driving solo across California. I
        picked out a camp ground on <a href="http://hipcamp.com"><b>hipcamp.com</b></a> called Bullfrog Pond Campground
        as it was very close to the start of the race, approximately 5 miles. </p>
    <p>I must say, it was one of the nicest campground I have ever been to, located deep in the redwood forest, the
        views were unbeatable.  </p>
    <p>The drive up was so long and I ended up leaving so late from LA that I decided it would be prudent to stop at a
        conveniently located RV-park called Santa Nella RV Park. Luckily, I had the Thule Roof Rack box and placed all
        my camping gear inside, except for my air mattress, sleeping-bag and pillows. There was wifi, outlets and the
        bathrooms were very nice, with heated air, clean toilets/showers and even a padlock. </p>
    <p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-25 aligncenter"
            src="http://seangeleno.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/santa-nella-rv-park_02.jpg?w=300" alt="Sierra Exif JPEG"
            width="300" height="225"/>  </p>
    <p>After I woke up in the morning, I headed on out to the open highway, once again. Eventually, after driving for
        many hours, I decide to stop and get some provisions. As I was doing this, I stumbled upon YogaWorks Larkspur by
        total coincidence. I figured it was just a good of a time as any other to take a yoga class. I looked for the
        hardest one available, as I wanted to sweat and get my workout on. It was a YogaWorks Flow 2/3, however, it
        ended up feeling more like a 1/2 as the teacher went pretty slow and explained the poses quite a bit, as opposed
        to your typical vinyassa class at YogaWorks Montana Ave where you get drenched right away. </p>
    <p>After the yoga class, I headed out on the highway once more. I arrived by around 2 PM and set up camp. The road
        to the actual campsite was very windy, narrow and ascended very quickly, leaving you off at the top of a
        mountain. There were hiking trails all around. People were slowly trickling in. </p>
    <p>For some reason, I thought that the packet pick-up could be done on Friday so I drove the 40 miles total to and
        from Windsor High School, only to find out that they were still setting up for tomorrow, when the actual packet
        pick-up would occur. This was a bit disappointing, however, it was cool to see all the action unfolding for the
        next day. </p>
    <p>After a good nights sleep at the campground, I arose, ate breakfast, and headed out to packet pick-up. There was
        a mandatory meeting attended by all athletes before being able to actually pick-up the race packet. I learned
        that the race sold-out in approximately 3 minutes this year. That meant that all the people in attendance were
        pretty hard-core triathletes, planning over 6-months in advance, having $350 to put down before all the
        available slots were taken. </p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b><img class="alignnone  wp-image-24 aligncenter"
                                          src="http://seangeleno.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/img_0233.jpg?w=300"
                                          alt="IMG_0233" width="447" height="338"/></b></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>Pre-Race</b></p>
    <p>The format of the race started rather differently that most as 29 and under age groupers would go last, instead
        of first. This meant that there was about 2 hours from the beginning of the swim to the start of my wave. I must
        say it was quite a different experience, it allowed me to gain a new perspective, watching all the athletes head
        out on to the course. It also meant that, if fast enough, we would pass a huge field of athletes. </p>
    <p>It was rather nippy in the morning, although the water was clearly warmer than the air as it was very steamy. I
        kept walking around, trying to stay warm and take pictures of all the action. I was able to watch the pros run
        by as the exited the water, something I have never had the privilege of doing before. It was very inspiring to
        see them, hopefully one day, with enough hard work, I too will reach the pro rank. </p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>Swim – 00:36:09</b></p>
    <p>I had a really good swim. Before I started, I told myself that I should not start really hard and crazy like I
        have in the past, this causes me to lose my breath/rhythm very quickly, forcing me to stop, losing time.
        Instead, I told myself to think of it as a normal Wednesday morning session with Tower 26. This was a very
        beneficial state-of-mind to put myself in, remaining calm during these types of things is one of the ways to go
        fastest.</p>
    <p>It was a very interesting swim, most of the course was anywhere from 3-7 feet deep, which meant that any time you
        got tired, all you had to do was stand up, catch your breath and keep on truckin’ (or swimming).  It felt like
        the exact opposite of swimming in the ocean, totally safe at all times, in control and, especially, no great
        white sharks! This was especially relevant since there had been an unfortunate, freak accident, shark-attack the
        week before off the Manhattan Beach Pier.  </p>
    <p>It was a deep water start, so all the 29 and under, green capped athletes, myself included, walked into the water
        and waited for the gun to go off. I felt pretty calm and relaxed at this point, ready for the long day that lay
        ahead.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>T1 00:05:24</b></p>
    <p>T1 was muddy and rather chaotic. Since my wave started last, a whole 2 hours from the start of the race, we were
        able to see T1 being deconstructed as we ran towards our bikes. We had to put all our belongings into the
        provided plastic bags so that they could be transported back to T2 at Windsor High School, 15 miles away. I took
        my time to make sure I had placed everything in its right place, which lead to my slower transition time.
        However, since this was such a long race, relatively speaking, I decided that the extra time spent in T2 would
        be well worth it. Hopefully, in the future I will be faster.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>Bike – 3:31:36</b></p>
    <p>In order to make sure there weren’t any surprises, I had driven the bike course the day before. This allowed me
        to have a much better perspective on what was to come, gauging my energy efforts accordingly.</p>
    <p>The beginning of the bike starts out with a rather steep hill, which I walked, calmly. After this, I hoped on my
        bike and tried to maintain the easiest cadence/energy output I could muster. I intended to try and conserve
        energy, leaving as much as possible for the last 6 miles of the run, at which point I wanted to try and put it
        all down on the line. This idea worked fantastically. I originally predicted that there would be a lot of
        suffering coming in on the ride, especially at around mile 39. However, this did not happen, in fact, I felt
        very good at that point, it was hard to believe.</p>
    <p>My outstanding performance can be partly attributed to my correct intake of nutrition. During my previous 70.3, a
        few weeks prior, in Folsom, I had bungled my nutrition in spectacular fashion. I had relied too heavily on plain
        water, didn’t use Perpeteum and even dropped a water bottle at one point, rendering my parched for quite a few
        miles, a fatal flaw in triathlon. This meant that by the time I arrived at the last 10 miles of the bike, my
        legs were shutting down, cramping and I just kept digging myself deeper and deeper into a hole of pure
        misery.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>Nutrition</b></p>
    <p>3 Roctane Salt Caps w/ Ginger Root (soothes stomach, supposedly) right after the swim</p>
    <p>Electrolyte fluids throughout</p>
    <p>Small amounts of water every 10 minutes</p>
    <p>3 bite-sized Bonk Breakers</p>
    <p>5 oz of Perpeteum, 1 squeeze/swig every 30 minutes</p>
    <p>2 Salt Stick Caps every 20-30 minutes</p>
    <p>With this particular combination, I was able to continue like the Energizer bunny, it was incredible, especially
        since I do not really go for such a long time during my training rides, not to mention use all the nutrition
        that I consumed. I only felt my lower back hurt during the ride, stretching probably would’ve helped with
        this.</p>
    <p> At no point did I feel even a slight cramp, my legs were in great condition, I do not think I have ever felt
        this good after riding for that long. I kept thinking to myself that I was excited and looking forward to the
        run, something that is very unusual for me. I knew that I had to have the right mentality, otherwise I would be
        toast.</p>
    <p>The bike course was spectacular, the entire ride consisted of smooth rolling hills, with very few pot holes, many
        sections of just recently paved highway, two small climbs, surrounded by mile after mile of vineyards and mostly
        covered by the shade of trees along the road. I felt like was moving pretty quickly, it seemed as if every time
        I glanced at my Garmin, it said I was riding at around 20mph.</p>
    <p>As I was approaching the end of the bike course, I gained a race buddy. I didn’t get a chance to catch his name,
        he seemed like a pretty cool guy. I saw this dude start to cramp up on the last 2 miles of the bike, all I could
        think to myself was what a tough time he was going to have if he was already cramping up then. He cheered me on
        as I passed him. We ended up running out of transition at about the same time.<img

                height="300"/></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"> </p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>T2 – xx:xx:xx</b></p>
    <p>As I was arriving to T2 I unbuckled my shoes, perfectly, placing my foot on top of the cycling shoe, this allowed
        me to hop-off with ease and made for an overall faster transition.</p>
    <p>I frantically started looking for my running gear, it wasn’t were I remembered putting it. I started to panic,
        neverhtless, there it was, I found it. I racked my bike up and proceeded to sit down, giving me a better
        position to change. I switched my thin, black cycling socks for my new compression socks. <b>As I was doing
            this, I had to take off my timing chip, a critical mistake</b>. As I did that, I thought to myself “man, I
        should be careful or I’m going to forget my chip,” however, I was so concentrated with the race that this
        thought didn’t even matter, I bolted out of T2 ready for action, sadly, <b>leaving my timing chip behind</b>.
        The crazy thing is: I didn’t even realize until half-way through the run, when the timing mats weren’t making
        those funky robot noises as I ran over them, leading me to stop in my tracks, cursing at the realization of what
        I had just done.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>Run – xx:xx:xx</b></p>
    <p>This was by far my best performance at the half-ironman distance. I was so ready to run, all my training boiled
        down to this moment. I thought to myself that it was not that hard as I had just run/walked all the way from my
        house to the Venice pier (16 miles). I felt like I was flying, the mile markers/aid stations were just coming
        one after the other. During my previous races, I have tended to feel pretty demoralized at the start of the run,
        like a giant mountain that I have to climb. That makes for a painful run. Not this time, I think my compression
        socks really helped me, my calves were feeling extraordinary, no pain, no cramping, just pure glory. At this
        point, I passed my race buddy, again he cheered me on.</p>
    <p>Since this was such a new experience for me, it felt rather odd, it was quite hard to know how much longer this
        type of thing could go on for. Would I simply crash within a few miles? Or would I be able to endeavor, pushing
        hard the whole way? Only time could tell at that point.</p>
    <p>Before I knew it, I reached the “La Crema” winery, I could see it standing tall in the distance, amongst the
        vineyards. This was an interesting loop, it felt rather disconcerting, however, because I didn’t realize just
        how long that loop was, my Garmin read 8 miles, but we just kept running and running, I thought we surely had to
        turn around soon. Sure enough, the turnaround came and it was at this point I noticed something funny about the
        timing mats. Why weren’t they making that freaky noise when I was running over them? I stopped for a second,
        looked down, and let out a giant groan of angst/expletives <b>as I realized my T2 thoughts were correct, I left
            my timing chip on the grass.</b></p>
    <p>As can be imagined, this was a terrible blow to my psyche, instead of simply focusing on racing hard, a stream of
        thoughts flooded my head, creating doubt, uncertainty and despair. After a few seconds, I gained my composure,
        and simply said, “F#$k it!” and continued running. Even though I had somewhat convinced myself that they would
        fix-it somehow, either via photos or writing down who was at the finish line, however, in the end I was wrong, I
        simply didn’t get a time and pretty much got DQ’d. It always amazes me the things that you learn and have to
        plan for races like this, especially since they are so few and far in between. You have to travel to the race,
        participate and then contemplate on all the things that could’ve been improved. I must say, this was almost as
        bad as the time I missed the 4<sup>th</sup> lap of the bike at Pacific Groove’s Olympic distance race in
        September 2013. On the bright side, I’ll be extra careful and make sure this type of thing doesn’t happen
        again. </p>
    <p>I pushed as hard as I could without over-doing it, and, admittedly, had to do a bit of a mini-walk after running
        for a while, never more than 10 seconds before running as hard as I could.</p>
    <p>In hindsight, altering my running speed so much, from around 8:30 to 7:30 to  walking @ 15:00 min/mi for a few
        seconds, really caused me to fatigue unnecessarily. In the future I will try to maintain a more modest, stable
        run pace in order to maximize my energy. At least now I know that I can actually make it this far without even
        the slightest cramp, something that had proved impossible for me before. Travelling</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-29"
                                          src="http://seangeleno.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/img_0223.jpg?w=300"
                                          alt="IMG_0223" width="300" height="224"/></b></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>Post-Race</b></p>
    <p>I was so happy to have finished, nevertheless, terribly demoralized from having left my chip. I was in such good
        shape by the end that I could’ve easily kept going. This is good news for my very first upcoming Ironman at Lake
        Tahoe in September. </p>
    <p>Right after, I walked around thinking of what the best thing to do about my timing chip was. At this point, I
        realized that eating the food the organizers of Vineman provided would probably be the best thing to do. As I
        ate, I felt the life coming back to me.</p>
    <p>I learned a great amount from this race and it was one of my best performances so far. I can’t wait to do the
        race again next year. Hopefully I will have the opportunity to sign-up on time as the race sells-out SOO quickly
        every year.</p>
